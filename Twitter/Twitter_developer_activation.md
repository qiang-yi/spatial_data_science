## Step 2: Activate Developer Account

2.1 When you have signed in the Developer Portal using your Twitter account, you'll need to answer a few questions to get the Essential access. Please select 'No' for "Will you make Twitter content or derived information available to a government entity or a government affiliated entity?".

2.2 You need to add both a phone number and email to your account if you haven't. Enter the verification code to verify your phone number/email. When your phone/email is added, go back to the basic questions.

  You may need to refresh the webpage after adding the phone number/email.

2.5 Now, your API keys and tokens are generated. These keys are like password for your program to interact with the Twitter APIs. Please save the **API key and API Key Secrete** (we don't use Bearing Token) in a text file or Word document for later use. Don't worry if you lost them. You can always re-generate them in the Developer Portal.

After you have saved the API keys and tokens, click `Skip to dashboard`.

## Step 3. Activate Elevated Access
After completing Step 2, you have obtained the Essential Access in the Developer Portal. Next, you will apply for the Elevated Access to gain more advanced features of the Twitter APIs.

3.1 In the Developer Portal, click `Product` -> `Twitter API v2` -> `Elevated` -> `Apply for Elevated`. Fill Basic info and then click `Next`.

Write a few of sentences to describe how you plan to use Twitter data and/or APIs. You can modify the following description to claim you will study a topic of your interest (e.g. the topic could be any sport events, natural disasters, political events, or culture...). 3-4 sentences should be enough. Please do not submit the identical description. Twitter may detect it and ask more questions.

Choose `No` for all the following questions, and click `Next`. Click `Next` again in the Review page.

Agree the Developer agreement & policy and click `Submit.`

If you are lucky enough, your application will be approved immediately and you may see "You have Elevated access" in the Developer Portal.

Sometimes, you will see "Your application for Elevated access is pending".

Later, you'll receive an email from Twitter asking for more details. The following figure shows an example of the email. Just write a few sentences to answer the first two questions, and answer "not applicable" for the other questions. For the second question, you may say that "**I will create maps or conduct analysis of Tweets aggregated in countries/states/counties. I will not display or publish Tweets at individual/row level by any means**".

You may receive additional emails for your application. Just provide more to respond to their questions. Eventually, you will receive an email informing the approval of your Elevated Access.
