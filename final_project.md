## Spatial Data Science (GEO6119)

# Final Project


### `Due on Sunday 12/4. Please compress the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and associated data in a zip file, and submit the zip file in Canvas`
---

In the final project, you need to create a Jupyter Notebook and write Python program by yourself to analyze geospatial data. You can choose one or more datasets in the [GeoDA data inventory](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/) or any other data sources for the analyses. Alternatively, you can directly access to the GeoDA data  from the [`libpysal` library](https://pysal.org/libpysal/notebooks/examples.html). If you are interested in a study in Florida, the [Florida Geographic Data Library (FGDL)](https://www.fgdl.org/metadataexplorer/explorer.jsp) is a good source to obtain local data in Florida.

The Python program should include the entire process of data analysis including but not limited to reading data, data preview, manipulation, mapping and analysis. It is recommended to do the final project in a Jupyter Notebook. In addition to Python code, you should include the following information in the text (markdown) cells:

 - Brief description of code.
 - The interpretation of the analysis result (what the result tells us).

The project should include **at least four** of the following analysis methods. The methods can be applied in one or more datasets.

- Choropleth map
- Statistic graphs (e.g. histogram, bar chart or pie chart)
- Kernel density map
- Mean center and standard distance circle
- Mean center and standard deviational ellipse
- Quadrat Count Analysis
- Mean nearest neighbor distance (NND)
- K-function
- Scatter plot of spatial autocorrelation (variable vs. spatial lag)
- Global spatial autocorrelation (e.g. Moran's _I_)
- Local spatial autocorrelation (e.g. local Moraon's _I_, hot spots, cold spot...)
- Spatial join/attribute join
- Attribute join
- Zonal operation
- Extract raster value in point
- Spatial interpolation

> You can refer to previous labs, online tutorials, code snippets to write Python code. However, a complete copy of others' work is prohibited. You need to modify and/or extend the code to analyze your data.
